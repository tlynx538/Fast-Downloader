- **Integrity Verification**  
  Supports SHA256 hash verification to ensure the downloaded file is not corrupted.

- **Real-time Progress Display**  
  Provides a dynamic command-line interface showing overall progress and active download threads.

- **Single-threaded Fallback**  
  Gracefully falls back to single-threaded download if the server does not support range requests.

```

Then, install dependencies:

- `-f, --force`  
  Overwrite the file if it already exists in the output directory.  
  Default: False

- `-v, --verbose`  
  Enable verbose logging (shows thread-level and chunk-level debug info).  
  Default: False

- `--sha256 <HASH>`  
  Expected SHA256 hash of the file. After download, the fileâ€™s hash will be verified against this.  
  Default: None (no verification)

## Examples

### Basic Download

```bash
python3 main.py https://example.com/large_file.zip
```

### Download to a Specific Directory

```bash
python3 main.py https://example.com/file.tar.gz -o /path/to/downloads
```

### Download with SHA256 Verification

```bash
python3 main.py https://releases.ubuntu.com/24.04.2/ubuntu-24.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso \
  --sha256 d7fe3d6a0419667d2f8eff12796996328daa2d4f90cd9f87aa9371b362f987bf
```

### Resume an Interrupted Download

```
The downloader automatically detects incomplete chunks and resumes only the missing parts.

### Overwrite Existing File with Verbose Output and Logging to File

```bash
python3 main.py https://example.com/file.iso -f
